They're demos to highlight as many features as quickly as possible.They're great for showing off what a framework can do. They aren't so great for teaching you how to build web apps.The end result is a basic application that doesn't mimic what it's like building real applications as a front-end developer. You'll work with a mocked API and database. Application architecture isn't covered. Automated testing is skipped altogether.Trust me, I've been there. But those days are over. With The Angular Tutorial, you'll learn how to build applications using a real API and database. You'll leverage 3rd party APIs like Zomato, Google Places, and open-source libraries just as you would in a real job.The Angular Tutorial assumes you have no previous knowledge of the Angular framework. It starts at the very beginning.Every piece of code is explained and tested to make you interview ready. You'll begin with an introduction to how web applications work followed by an introduction to Angular to give you a good grasp on the basics. Then you'll learn how to setup a real database and API just as I've done at numerous companies ranging from venture capital, startups, Fortune 500 companies, and digital agencies working with companies like CNN, Turner Broadcasting System, NBC, Mazda, AutoTrader and The Home Depot. After that is a deeper dive into Angular where you'll build a real application with features like a signup page, a login page, a dashboard for authenticated users, and a calendar displaying lunch dates which you can show off on your resume or to your friends. You'll deploy this application to the web using Heroku so the proof of your work will be accessible to anyone. ✅ Forms - Template-driven forms or reactive forms? Don't worry, both are covered. ✅ E2E Testing - Fast and easy end-to-end testing of your application with Cypress. ✅ Unit Testing - Unit test your code with Karma and Jasmine. ✅ Services - Communicate with a backend using Angular's HttpClient and write your own interceptors. ✅ Authentication - Secure your application with JSON Web Tokens (JWT). ✅ Authorization - Learn to restrict sections of your application to authorized users. ✅ Module Architecture - Create dumb components, feature modules, and learn to break down an application into smaller parts. ✅ OSS Integration - Why re-invent the wheel? Learn to use open-source libraries to your advantage just as you would on the job. ✅ API Documentation - Learn how to read API documentation so you have the confidence going forward to work with any API. ✅ Deployment - Get your application onto the web. Learn how to build and deploy your Angular application to Heroku.",

This practical book takes experienced web developers through the new discipline of frontend architecture, including the latest tools, standards, and best practices that have elevated frontend web development to an entirely new level. Using real-world examples, case studies, and practical tips and tricks throughout, author Micah Godbolt introduces you to the four pillars of frontend architecture. He also provides compelling arguments for developers who want to embrace the mantle of frontend architect and fight to make it a first-class citizen in their next project. The four pillars include: Code: how to approach the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of a design system Process: tools and processes for creating an efficient and error-proof workflow Testing: creating a stable foundation on which to build your site Documentation: tools for writing documentation while the work is in progress",

Front End Drupal tackles this problem directly and is designed to help both experienced designers and rank novices get an understanding of how Drupal theming works. In fact, I’ll be the first to admit I learned a lot from this book.” – Dries Buytaert, Drupal founder and project lead The Practical, Complete Guide to Customizing Drupal Sites with Behaviors, Themes, and Templates Drupal is now the world’s #1 open source content management system: Thousands of individuals and organizations are using it to build and update Web sites of virtually every kind. As Web designers and developers adopt Drupal, they need ways to quickly customize the visuals and interactivity of their sites. Drupal offers powerful tools for doing so, but little guidance on using them effectively. Front End Drupal is the solution. In this book, two expert Drupal developers cover everything you need to know to create great visual designs and state-of-the-art interactivity with Drupal’s behaviors, themes, and templates. Front End Drupal is 100% focused on issues of site design, behavior, usability, and management. The authors show how to style Drupal sites, make the most of Drupal’s powerful templating system, build sophisticated community sites, streamline site management, and build more portable, flexible themes. You’ll also gain hands-on experience through several case studies that walk you through the customization of everything from page templates to Web site forums. Prepare and organize content so it’s easier to integrate into Drupal Web sites Structure Drupal page templates that are easy to work with Configure Drupal with the modules and browser tools you need to customize your site Utilize Drupal’s Starter Themes and themes converted from WordPress, Joomla!™, and Drupal 5.x Maximize the power and usability of Drupal’s content editing forms Build usable community sites with user profiles, comments, and user-generated content Use JavaScript™ to make your themes interactive and to enhance usability Create powerful animations and AJAX callbacks with jQuery, Drupal’s JavaScript library About the Web Site The accompanying site, frontenddrupal.com, contains all sample code and themes presented in this book.",
